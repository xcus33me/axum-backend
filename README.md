A backend project built in Rust using `Tokio`, `Axum`, and `SQLx` for high-performance, asynchronous web applications. This project offers a solid foundation for building scalable APIs with minimal latency.

## Tech Stack
- **Tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for handling high concurrency.
- **Axum**: Web framework for routing and request management.
- **SQLx**: Async ORM for easy database access with compile-time checked SQL.

## Features
- Asynchronous CRUD operations with database transactions.
- Scalable route and middleware setup.
- Database migrations for schema management.

## Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Configure the database settings.**
3. **Run migrations** with `sqlx`.
4. **Start the server** with `cargo run`.
